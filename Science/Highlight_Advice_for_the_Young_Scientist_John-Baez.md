advice for young scientist

Keep playing around with all sorts of ideas, techniques and tools. Read voraciously. Don't be scared of experts and their jargon. Become one yourself, but then give the game away by explaining things in simple language whenever possible. Talk to lots of people! Teach them; learn from them; don't worry too much about impressing them. Don't be scared to ask basic questions - and don't be surprised when nobody knows the answers. The simplest questions are the last to be answered.

To succeed, you must be both idealistic and practical. 

Some practical tips

Go to the most prestigious school and work with the best possible advisor. A good advisor will give you a hot topic to work on there you can get results that people will find interesting. A good advisor will be so famous that merely being their student will cause people to be interested in you. A good advisor will to to bat for you when it comes time for you to get a job. A good advisor will be politically well-connected and lubricate your way straight to the holy groves of academe. A good advisor will also work your butt off and scae the crap out of you by expecting you to know about millions of things - don't let that put you off. 

Publish. Publish papers that get definitive results on fashionable subjects, so they'll get cited. Publish papers that open up promising new lines of investigation. Publish papers that people can actually read -but don't tell anyone else this, or every one will start doing it, and then where will you be? Publish papers that show you have your own research program. Publish papers that create a shock wave the moment they hit the archive! But most importantly: publish.
